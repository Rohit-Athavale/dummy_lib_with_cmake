Design Goals
------------------------
This dummy library is being used an example for the following

	- Using CMake to build a shared library (dummyl)
	- Compiling and linking a C++ Application that uses the dummyl library
	- Creation of C-style wrappers for the C++ library
	- Usage of the C-wrappers in a pure C application
